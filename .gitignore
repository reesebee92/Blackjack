Mini-Project 2:

Please do the following to complete this assignment. 

Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to provide non-trivial practice in the use of Java  programming constructs and have a bit of fun doing it.

Application Design:

The word-processed document file formats accepted will be either .docx or .pdf. The length of the document should be between 1 and 2 pages. The following subjects should be discussed in this 
order:

1.	Include a UML class diagram, or other diagram of your choice, or written description of your solution.

2.	What alternative design approaches were considered and why were they rejected?
 
Program Specification:

This project involves writing a program to simulate a blackjack card game. You will use a simple console-based user interface to implement this game.

A simple blackjack card game consists of a player and a dealer. A player is provided with a sum of money with which to play. A player can place a bet between $0 and the amount of money the player has. A player is dealt cards, called a hand. Each card in the hand has a point value. The objective of the game is to get as close to 21 points as possible without exceeding 21 points. A player that goes over is out of the game. The dealer deals cards to itself and a player. The dealer must play by slightly different rules than a player, and the dealer does not place bets. A game proceeds as follows: A player is dealt two cards face up. If the point total is exactly 21 the player wins immediately. If the total is not 21, the dealer is dealt two cards, one face up and one face down. A player then determines whether to ask the dealer for another card (called a “hit”) or to “stay” with his/her current hand. A player may ask for several “hits.” When a player decides to “stay” the dealer begins to play. If the dealer has 21 it immediately wins the game. Otherwise, the dealer must take
“hits” until the total points in its hand is 17 or over, at which point the dealer must “stay.” If the dealer goes over 21 while taking “hits” the game is over and the player wins. If the dealer’s points total exactly 21, the dealer wins immediately. There is only one deck of cards. It is up to Player / Dealer to decide whether the value is 1 or 11, based on the hands they have.  When the dealer and player have finished playing their hands, the one with the highest point total is the winner. Play is repeated until the player decides to quit or runs out of money to bet. You must use an object-oriented solution for implementing this game.
